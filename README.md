# Audio Reverse

### Specification
Write a program called reverse that enables us to reverse a WAV file given by the user and create a new WAV file that contains the resulting reversed audio. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll limit the files we deal with to the WAV format. At the time the user executes the program, they should provide, using two command-line arguments, the name of the input file to be read and reversed, and the name of the output file they would like to save the resulting audio in. A successfully executed program should not output any text, and should create a WAV file with the user-specified name that plays the audio of the input WAV file in reverse. For example:

#### $ ./reverse input.wav -> output.wav
